# Simple-Calculator
Simple Calculator. Not too advanced once.

# My first Ever Project
This is my First ever Project created in python when i just started learning it.

With a bit knowledge of a module and some basics operators and syntaxes-
I made this without any help from internet used my own sense that How these functions may work if I apply.

# At the End
It's pretty simple calculator lol
